what remarkably stupid things am i doing on a regular basis to absolutely screw up my life?

But one of the main reasons that people don't get wht they wnat is because they don't actually figure out what it is 

And so since success is a very narrow line in the very unlikely the probability that you're going to stuble on it randomly is 0

if you actually want someting, you can have it but maybe you can have what you need
and maybe all you have to do to get it is ask

it's like 3 years from now, you can have what you need.

you got to be careful about it. you can't have everything.

You can have what would be good for you. 

But you have to figure out what it is. and then you have to aim at it. 

it's like you have to be deadly serious about it.

you have to think "okay, like i'm talking stock of myself"

and if i was going to live properly in the world. and i was going to set myself up. such that being with justyfy itself in my estimation and i don't mean as a harsh judge "exactly what is it that i would aim at?"

You're perfectly capable of immnese feats of imaginations and dream and fantasies.

is this it's three to five years down the road and you let that part of your character dominate what particular corner of hell is it that you're now occupied?

And so now you have something to aim at. you have a purpose.

And then that's motivating people need to purpose in life.

You need a purpose neural chemically because without a purpose you don't feel any positive motivation or any positive emotion

our positive emotion is linked to our pursuit of valuable goals that's how our brains are set up  

And the other thing, that's so interesting about being alilve is that you're all in.

No matter what you do
